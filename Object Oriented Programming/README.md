# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) üìò

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and structure software. It emphasizes reusability, modularity, and scalability, making it a fundamental approach in modern software development.

### Key Principles of OOP:
1. **Encapsulation** - Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).
2. **Abstraction** - Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
3. **Inheritance** - Enabling a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse.
4. **Polymorphism** - Allowing different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.

## Why is OOP Important?
- Enhances code **reusability** and **maintainability**.
- Promotes **scalability** and **modularity** in large applications.
- Improves **code organization** and **readability**.
- Forms the foundation for many modern programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, and C#.
