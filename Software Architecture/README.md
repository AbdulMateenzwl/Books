# Software Architecture

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating these structures and systems. It defines the high-level organization of software components, the relationships between them, and the guiding principles for design and evolution. A well-structured architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, performance, and security.

## Why Software Architecture is Important?
1. **Scalability:** Ensures the system can handle growth efficiently.
2. **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to update and improve the system.
3. **Performance Optimization:** Provides strategies for handling large-scale operations efficiently.
4. **Security & Reliability:** Helps in designing secure and fault-tolerant systems.
5. **Code Reusability:** Encourages modularization and reuse of components.
