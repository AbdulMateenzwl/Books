# 📂 Design Patterns

## 📖 What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide best practices that help developers create scalable, maintainable, and efficient code. These patterns are categorized into **creational, structural, and behavioral** patterns, each addressing different aspects of software architecture.

## 🎯 Why Are Design Patterns Important?
- **Improve Code Reusability:** Solutions are tested and proven to work in different scenarios.
- **Enhance Maintainability:** Code becomes easier to understand and modify.
- **Encourage Best Practices:** Promote software design principles such as SOLID.
- **Improve Collaboration:** Common vocabulary makes it easier for developers to communicate.
