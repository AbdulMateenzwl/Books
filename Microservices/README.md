# Microservices

## Introduction
Microservices architecture is a modern software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each service is designed to handle a specific business capability and communicates with other services using lightweight protocols such as HTTP or messaging queues. This approach enables scalability, flexibility, and ease of deployment, making it ideal for cloud-native applications.

### Why Microservices Matter
- **Scalability**: Microservices allow independent scaling of different components based on demand.
- **Flexibility**: Developers can use different technologies for different services.
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service does not necessarily bring down the entire system.
- **Faster Development & Deployment**: Continuous delivery and deployment become more manageable.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, modular services are easier to update and debug.
