# System Design

## What is System Design?
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and data flow of a software system to meet specific requirements. It involves making high-level design choices about scalability, reliability, performance, and maintainability. System design is crucial for building robust applications that can handle high traffic and large datasets efficiently.

## Why is System Design Important?
- **Scalability**: Ensures that the system can handle increasing loads efficiently.
- **Reliability**: Helps in building fault-tolerant systems that can recover from failures.
- **Performance**: Optimizes response times and resource utilization.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies debugging, upgrades, and code modifications.
- **Security**: Ensures data integrity and protection from cyber threats.
